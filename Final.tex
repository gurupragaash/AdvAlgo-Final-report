\section{Multiway Cut}

Consider an undirected graph G = (V, E) with vertices V = $\{1, 2, $\dots$, n\}$ and edges E with weights w: E $\rightarrow R^{+}$. Let T = $\{1, 2, . . . , k\} \subseteq$ V be a set of terminals. Multiway Cut is the problem of finding a minimum cost cut C $\subseteq$ E such that no connected component of G(V, E - C) contains two terminals from T. In case of just two terminals, minimum multiway cut is just a min s-t cut problem and hence can be solved in polynomial time by running a maximum flow algorithm from one terminal to the other. But when the number of terminals becomes $\ge 3$, then the problem of computing the minimum weight multiway cut is NP-hard and max SNP-hard even for fixed $k \ge 3$ by Dahlhaus, Johnson, Papadimitriou, Seymour and Yannakakis. In other words, there is a constant $\delta >$ 1 such that it is NP-Hard to even approximate the solution to within a ratio of less than $\delta$. Unless P = NP, there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme for Multiway Cut.

\section{APX-Hard/SNP-Hard}
 APX(Approximable) class is a set of NP optimization problems in which algorithms can be used to find an answer within some fixed multiplicative factor of the optimal answer. APX class is also known as MAX-SNP. A problem is said to be SNP-hard if it does not have a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme(PTAS).
 
\section{Related Work} 
\subsection{Isolation Heuristic}

Dahlhaus et al.\cite{Dahlhaus} initiated the study of multiway cut problems. They proposed a simple combinatorial isolation heuristic to approximate the solution to these kinds of problems.In isolation heuristic, given a undirected weighted graph G = (V,E) and K terminals, in each iteration we attach one terminal to the source and all the other terminals to the sink and then run a max-flow algorithm and find the min-cut for each turn. Let the edge set after each iteration be $E_i$. Now the lowest k-1 cuts are taken and the union of them gives the multi-way cut. This algorithm gives an approximation of $2(1-\frac{1}{k})$.\\\\
\textbf{Proof:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run the isolation heuristic scheme and get the set of edges. Let they be A.
    \item Let $E^*$ be the optimal edge set for the multiway cut with K terminals. Then it means if $E^*$ is removed then there will be $K$ disjoint connected graphs ($V_1, V_2,\cdots,V_k$), each having one terminal respectively.
    \item $E^* = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{E_i^*}$ and each $E_i^*$ represents the edges removed to disconnect $V_i$ from rest.
    \item Let $\delta(V_i)$ denote the set of all outgoing edges from $V_i$.
    \item Now we can say that, $w(E_i) \le w(\delta(V_i))$ because both isolate the terminal $i$ from the rest and we know $E_i$ is the mincut. So $w(E_i)$ cannot be greater than $w(\delta(V_i))$
    \item Lets says there are $m$ edges between $V_i$ and $V_{i+1}$. Then both $\delta(V_i)$ and $\delta(V_{i+1})$ will include those $m$ edges.
    \item $2w(E^*) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{\delta(V_i)} $. It is 2 times since each edge is double counted in the process.
    \item We know $w(A) \le (1 -\frac{1}{k})(\sum_{i=1}^k w(E_i^*))$. This is because, A is union of first K-1 smallest set. In this expression, we are adding up all the $K$ values. Since only $k-1$ values are taken, we are multiplying it with $1 - \frac{1}{k}$ and since it the union of all these set, it will be equal to or less than the summation of indiviual sets.
        \begin{align*}
            w(A) &\le (1 -\frac{1}{k})(\sum_{i=1}^k w(E_i^*)) \\
            &\le (1 -\frac{1}{k})(\sum_{i=1}^k w{\delta(V_i)}\\
            &\le 2(1 -\frac{1}{k})w(E^*)\\
          w(A)  &\le 2(1 -\frac{1}{k}) OPT
        \end{align*}

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Alon's Improvement}
Noga Alon~\cite{Dahlhaus_Alon} observed that for the special cases of k = 4 and k = 8 improvements can be obtained using a variant of the isolation heuristic. For k = 4, the Isolation Heuristic provides a guarantee of 3/2. An improved guarantee of 4/3 can be obtained as follows: For each partition of the terminals into sets $S_1$,$S_2$ of size two, use max flow techniques to
compute the minimum cut that separates the terminals in $S_1$ from those in $S2$. Output the union of the two best such cuts. The reader can readily verify that this union is a 4-way cut whose weight is at most 4/3 optimal. This approach requires only three max flow computations versus the four needed by the Isolation Heuristic, so it is faster as well.For k = 8, the guarantee of our theorem can be improved from 7/4 to 12/7. Unfortunately, the above approach did not yield improvements over the Isolation Heuristic for any values of k other than 4 and 8.

\subsection{Greedy Split Algorithm}
There is another greedy algorithm technique that can be used to solve the multiway cut problem. 
This algorithm also has an approximation ratio of $2 - \frac{2}{k}$. The algorithm is as follows:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -3pt
\item Find the cheapest cut that splits G into 2 components such that each contains atleast a  terminal
\item Find the cheapest cut dividing the 2 components such that each of the 3 components contains atleast a  terminal
\item Find the cheapest cut dividing the 3 components such that each of the 4 components contains atleast a terminal
\item The steps are repeated until each of the k components contains a terminal. At each step, the algorithm chooses the cheapest cut among all components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Polyhedral Approach}
Chopra et al.\cite{chopra_1,chopra_2} and Cunningham\cite{cunningham} investigated on solving multiway cut problem using a polyhedral approach.But these two approaches too had an approximation ratio of $2(1 - \frac{1}{k})$.

\textbf{Chopra et al.} proposed an integer formulation and studied the associated polyhedron. They further proposed an extended formulation  which was tighter than all known solution at that time and also observed that when the underlying graph is a tree, the multiway cut problem can be solved in linear time by a straightforward dynamic programming algorithm.

\textbf{Cunningham} showed that for one particular formulation of the problem, the value of the minimum multiway cut is almost twice of its linear relaxation.

\subsection{Non-linear Formulation}
Bertsimas et al.\cite{Bertsimas} proposed a non-linear formulation of the multiway cut. Here the optimal solution formulated was an integral one. They suggested several polynomial time-solvable relaxations and gave a simple randomized rounding argument yielding the same approximation ratio of $2(1 - \frac{1}{k})$

\section{Preliminaries of Proposed Solution}
\subsection{Basic Notations}
\subsubsection{Simplex Solution}
A simplex is a generalization of the notion of a convex polyhedron to arbitrary dimensions. In our case, we solve the linear programs using the simplex formulation. A $k$ dimension simplex has $k + 1$ vertices. Linear programs can be solved using the simplex approach.Linear program operates on simplicial cones, and these become proper simplices with an additional constraint. The simplicial cones in question are the corners (i.e., the neighborhoods of the vertices) of a geometric object called a polytope. The shape of this polytope is defined by the constraints applied to the objective function. For solving the multiway cut, we keep the k terminals as vertices and develop a $k-1$ dimensional convex polytope given by $\{x \in {\mathbb R}^k \vert \ (x \ge 0) \wedge (\sum_i x_i = 1) \}$

\subsubsection{L1 Norm}
L1-norm is also known as Mean-Absolute Error(MAE) or Sum of Absolute Difference(SAD). It is basically used to find the sum of the all the value of a variable. L1 norm of x is basically denoted by $\vert\vert x \vert\vert$. It can also be used to find the difference between two variables
\begin{align*}
\text{SAD}(x_1, x_2) = \vert \vert x_1 - x_2 \vert \vert = \sum \vert x_1 - x_2 \vert
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Unit Vector}
Unit vectors are used for denoting the spatial direction and generally represent the axes of a cartesian co-ordinate system. In our case, the unit vectors are used to represent the position of the vertices of the graph on the $k-1$ dimensional simplex. For j = 1, 2,$\dots$,k, $e^j \in \mathbb{R}$ denotes the unit vector given by $(e^j)_j$ = 1 and $(e^j)_i$ = 0 for all i $\notin$ j.

\subsubsection{Semimetric}
Semimetric is a pair $(V, d)$, where $V$ is a set and $d$ is a function which operates on $V$ such that $d: V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $\forall u,v \in V$.
\begin{align*}
d(u, v) &= d(v, u) \ge 0\\
d(u, u) &= 0\\
d(u,v) &\le d(u,w) + d(w,v) 
\end{align*}

\section{Linear Programmning  Relaxations}
\subsection{LP1 and LP2}
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \qquad  \sum\limits_{uv \in E}{c(u, v) \ d(u, v)} \ \text{is the objective function}
\end{align*}
\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{align}    
\text{such that} \ \qquad & (V,d) \text{ is a semimetric}\\
&d(t_1, t_2) = 1 \quad \forall t_1, t_2 \in T, t_1 \neq t_2\\
&d(u, v) \in (0,1) \forall u, v \in V
\end{align}

\caption{Sample Graph}
\label{fig:sample_graph}
\end{wrapfigure}
Consider the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:sample_graph}. Let nodes A and E be terminals and we want to find a cut. In the LP, all the $d(u,v)$ where $uv$ is an valid edges is the decision variable and the value of it can be 0 or 1. From equation 3, we can say that $d(A, E) = 1$ and we don't know the other values. But based on equation 7, we can write $d(A, E) \le d(A, B) + d(B, E)$, $d(A, E) \le d(A, C) + d(C, E)$ and $d(A, E) \le d(A, D) + d(B, D)$. These contribute to the additional constraints which are derived from the constraint $(V,d)$ is a semimetric.Now the LP can should assign atleast value 1 to one of the pairs in $(d(A, B), d(B, E))$, $d(A, C),  d(C, E)$ and $d(A, D) + d(B, D)$. Assign the d(u, v) with a value 1 means, selecting the edge for the cut. Since our objective function is to minimize it, the LP will find which edge costs minimum and that will be the optimal solution. The authors want to come up with much more stricter constraints to reduce the number of valid solution. Lets look into the constraint $\sum\limits_{t \in T}{d(u, t)} = k - 1 \quad \forall u \in V$ using the example from the Figure.In this example, the nodes A, B and C are terminals. If we run our LP without the new constraints, there are four valid solutions, which represent the cuts {(AD, DB), (AD, DC), (DB, DC) and (AD, DB, DC)}. In this set of values, (AD, DB, DC) is not a optimal one but still is a valid solution. In a large graph, there could be many such solution, which could increase the number of valid solution. But this one can be removed easily with the new constraint, $\sum\limits_{t \in T}{d(u, t)} = k - 1 \quad \forall u \in V$. The new constraint says, if there is a node u, as long as its not connected to more than one terminal it is fine. So if there are k nodes, then $\sum\limits_{t \in T}{d(u, t)} = k - 1$, which means only $K-1$ cuts are required and not $K$ cuts

\subsection{Successive Linear Programming}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -3pt
    \item As discussed earlier, any valid solution will split the Graph $G(V,E)$ into $K$ graphs ($C_1, C_2,\cdots,C_k$), with each $C_i$ having a terminal $S_i$
    \item Let $\delta(C_i)$ represent the set of edges which goes out of $C_i$
    \item Each vertex $v \in V$ is represented as $x_i^j$ and this value is set to 1 if the $i^{th}$ vertex is part of the component $C_i$, else its set to 0. Since a vertex can be a part of only one component, we can say that $\sum_{j=1}^{k}{x^j} = 1, \forall x \in V$, 
    \item We define another notation $z_e^i$ which operates on all the edges in E and is set to 1 if the edge $e$ is in $\delta(C_i)$ else its set to 0
    \item If $e$ is in the $\delta(C_i)$, then it connect $(u,v)$ where $u \in C_i, v \notin C_i$. Thus we can write $z_e^i$ as $z_e^i = x_u^i - x_v^i$, since $x_u^i$ will be 1 and $x_v^i$ will be 0, as per the definition of $x$. If $e$ is not in the $\delta(C_i)$, then both u and v belong to a same component, then both $x_u^i$ and $x_v^i$ will be 1 if both belong to component $C_i$ else both will be 0.
    \item Now for the objective function is $\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{e \in E}{c_e * \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}{z_e^i}}$, where $c_e$ is the cost/weight of the edge. We are multiplying it with $\frac{1}{2}$ because of the double counting which we discussed in the previous explanation.
           \begin{align*}
            \text{Minimize} \quad & \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{e \in E}{c_e * \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}{z_e^i}}\\
            \text{such that}  \quad z_e^i &= |x_u^i - x_v^i|, \quad \forall e \in E\\
            \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}{x_v^i} &= 1,\quad \forall v \in V\\
            x_{s_i}^i &= 1,\quad \forall s_i \in T \ \text{(Set of Terminals)}\\
            x_v^j &\ge 0, \quad \forall v \in V\quad (\text{Got by adding LP relaxation to }x_v^j \in (0,1),\quad \forall v \in V)\\
        \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\section{Rounding Algorithm}
The authors propose a randomized rounding algorithm to find the multiway cut with cost within a factor of $1.5 - \frac{1}{k}$ of the optimal solution. Take an optimal solution to the relaxation with edges whose endpoints differ in at most two coordinates, and let OPT denote its cost. Once we find the multiway cut of expected cost, we can use lemma 2 and proposition 3 and extend it to general cases.\\
  
Let $E_i$ = (u, v) $\in$ E $\vert x_{i}^u \neq x_{j}^v$. This is possible since two vertices of the edges lie in two different sets. Let $W_i = \sum_{e \in \epsilon_i}$ c(e).d(e). Without loss of generality, assume that $W_k$ is the greatest of $W_1, \dots , W_k$. The algorithm is used to get an integral solution for the simplex in which all the terminals are present as vertices. We define B(i,$\rho$) to be $\{u \in V \vert x_i^u > 1 - \rho \}$  and it contains the set of nodes which are closer to a terminal i in the simplex. Value of $\rho$ lies in thr range (0,1). Here B represents a ball around each terminal i having a radius $\rho$ and our intention is to find how the various nodes in the graph lie in the simplex using the algorithm.\\

The algorithm operates as follows. First, pick $\rho$ at random in (0, 1) and an ordering $\sigma$ from (1, 2, $\dots, k âˆ’- 1, k)$ \ and (k âˆ’- 1, k - 2, $\dots$ , 1, k). Then partition V into $ V_1, \dots , V_k$ as follows. Proceed in the order given by $\sigma$. Each
$V_i$ should contain all vertices in B(i, $\rho$) that have not already been assigned to a previous $V_i$. At the end, assign all unused vertices to $V_k$. The sets
$V_1, \dots , V_k$ are the components after removing the cut, and edges between vertices in two different sets are in the cut.More formally, the algorithm is:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Compute an optimal solution to relaxation
\item Renumber the terminals so that Wk is largest among $W_1, \dots , W_k$.
\item  Pick uniformly at random $\rho \in $(0, 1) and
$\sigma \in (1, 2, \dots , k - 1, k)$ \ or $ (k - 1, k - 2, \dots , 1, k)$. Here k is used as the overflow bin and is used only if you are not able to assign a node to any of the k-1 terminals in the simplex. Initially all the nodes are placed in the overflow bin and then the below steps are run.
\item For j = 1 to k âˆ’ 1: $V_{\sigma_j} \leftarrow B(j, \rho$) - $\bigcup_{i:i<j} V_{\sigma_i}$. Here basically we assign a node to a terminal only if they are not assigned to any of the previously traversed terminal regions.\
\item $V_k \leftarrow V - \bigcup_{i<k} V_i$. In this step, we assign all the remaining unassigned vertices to the overflow bin $V_k$ once the above loop is complete.

\item Let C be the set of edges that run between sets in the partition $V_1,\dots , V_k$.
